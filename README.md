1. Driving a MOSFET
1.1. Gate drive vs. base drive
Whereas the conventional bipolar transistor is a current-driven device, the MOSFET is a 
voltage-driven device.
Figure 1.1 illustrates a bipolar transistor. A current must be applied between the base and emitter 
terminals to produce a flow of current in the collector. Figure 1.2 shows a MOSFET, which produces a 
flow of current in the drain when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals.
The gate of a MOSFET is composed of a silicon oxide layer. Since the gate is insulated from the 
source, an application of a DC voltage to the gate terminal does not theoretically cause a current to 
flow in the gate, except in transient periods during which the gate is charged and discharged. In 
practice, the gate has a tiny current on the order of a few nanoamperes. When there is no voltage 
between the gate and source terminals, no current flows in the drain except leakage current, because 
of a very high drain-source impedance.
